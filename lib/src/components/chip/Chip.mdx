The `Chip` is a component in the shape of a pill that visually represents an object or a series of data providing feedback in context, such as filtering criteria, keywords or selection sets.

```tsx preview
<Chip label="Not the tasty kind" selected />
```

## Modes

There are two modes for different use cases of Chip, `filter` and `input`. Filter is a permanently displayed on/off toggle for things like filters. Input is a dismissable element, and as such contains a close button. The default mode is `filter`.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Chip label="Filter" selected={false} />
  <Chip label="Filter" selected />
  <Chip label="Input" mode="input" />
</>
```

## Selected

Most of the time this component will be used in a controlled state. The filter mode does work uncontrolled, but it is advised to use this in a controlled manner.

For filter mode, you need to pass in `selected` (a boolean), and `onSelectedChange`, which is a function that should accept a boolean.

For input mode, you can pass whatever function you want. If, for example, a state held an array of strings, that were then mapped through to display all currently selected Chips, you could pass `() => updateArray(label)` to handle removing that item from the array.

```tsx
<>
  <Chip label="Filter" selected={selected} onSelectedChange={setSelected} />
  <Chip label="Input" onSelectedChange={() => removeFromArray('Input')} />
</>
```

## Size

These are the available `size`s for this component: `sm`, `md` and `lg`. The default is `md`.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Chip label="Small" selected size="sm" />
  <Chip label="Medium" selected size="md" />
  <Chip label="Large" selected size="lg" />
</>
```

## Icon

When in input mode, the Chip accepts a custom icon to be displayed to the left of the label.

```tsx preview
<Chip mode="input" label="Chips go with" icon={Hamburger} />
```

## Disabled

Should you need to disable Chips, you can do so with the `disabled` prop.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Chip label="Filter" selected={false} disabled />
  <Chip label="Filter" selected disabled />
  <Chip label="Input" mode="input" disabled />
</>
```
