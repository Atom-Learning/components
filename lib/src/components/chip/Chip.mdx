The `Chip` is a component in the shape of a pill that visually represents an object or a series of data providing feedback in context, such as filtering criteria, keywords or selection sets.

```tsx preview
<Chip selected>Not the tasty kind</Chip>
```

## Modes

There are two modes for different use cases of Chip, `filter` and `input`. Filter is a permanently displayed on/off toggle for things like filters. Input is a dismissable element, and as such contains a close button. The default mode is `filter`.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Chip selected={false}>Filter</Chip>
  <Chip selected>Filter</Chip>
  <Chip mode="input">Input</Chip>
</>
```

## Selected

Most of the time this component will be used in a controlled state. The filter mode does work uncontrolled, but it is advised to use this in a controlled manner.

For filter mode, you need to pass in `selected` (a boolean), and `onSelectedChange`, which is a function that should accept a boolean.

For input mode, you can pass whatever function you want. If, for example, a state held an array of strings, that were then mapped through to display all currently selected Chips, you could pass `() => updateArray(label)` to handle removing that item from the array.

```tsx
<>
  <Chip selected={selected} onSelectedChange={setSelected}>
    Filter
  </Chip>
  <Chip onSelectedChange={() => removeFromArray('Input')}>Input</Chip>
</>
```

## Size

These are the available `size`s for this component: `sm`, `md` and `lg`. The default is `md`.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Chip selected size="sm">
    Small
  </Chip>
  <Chip selected size="md">
    Medium
  </Chip>
  <Chip selected size="lg">
    Large
  </Chip>
</>
```

## Icon

When in input mode, the Chip accepts a custom icon to be displayed to the left of the text.

```tsx preview
<Chip mode="input" icon={Hamburger}>
  Chips go with
</Chip>
```

## Disabled

Should you need to disable Chips, you can do so with the `disabled` prop.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Chip selected={false} disabled>
    Filter
  </Chip>
  <Chip selected disabled>
    Filter
  </Chip>
  <Chip mode="input" disabled>
    Input
  </Chip>
</>
```
