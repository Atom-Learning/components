description: A toast notification that gives non-intrusive feedback to the user and times out automatically

`Toast` has 2 exports, the `ToastProvider` component which is the container for all the notifications and the `toast` function that allows triggering the notification. It sets all the default behaviour, like pausing on hover and positioning and styles the different types of notification (`blank` (default), `error` and `success`).

This is the preferred user feedback way as it is not intrusive and it simply provides some state information to the user without waiting for feedback, ie: the information was saved. When feedback is required consider using the `AlertDialog` component.

```tsx preview
<ToastProvider>
  <Button onClick={() => toast.success('This is the toast message')}>
    Click for toast
  </Button>
</ToastProvider>
```

This component can render a string message by default. However, it can be overriden to show more complex component structure [Render more than a string](https://react-hot-toast.com/docs/toast). For more information on other configuration options and props, please read about the underlying behaviour at [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)
