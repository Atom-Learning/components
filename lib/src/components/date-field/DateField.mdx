`DateField` is the preferred way to render a form field for dates.

In addition to text `Label` (required) and a validation error (optional), `DateField` accepts all the same props as `DateInput` and will pass them on to the `DateInput` it renders. However, as with all our composed components,
`DateField`’s `css` prop will be applied to a containing `Box`—the styling of the individual components inside `DateField` cannot be altered.

Err on the side of using consistent form fields, but if you really need something with different styling then consider composing your own field from the
`DateInput`, `Label` and `ValidationError` components.

```tsx preview
<Form>
  <DateField name="exam-date" label="Exam date" initialDate={new Date()} />
</Form>
```
