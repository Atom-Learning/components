`SearchInput` wraps `Input` and adds an icon to visualise the specific input type, it's recommended to use this component when the user is performing a search query.
When the user types into the `SearchInput` the component renders a clear button that clears the typed value.

```tsx preview
<SearchInput name="search" css={{ width: 320 }} placeholder="Search" />
```
