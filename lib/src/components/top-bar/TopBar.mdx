`TopBar` exports components that combine to form the elements that you would expect to commonly see in a TopBar. However, the `TopBar` is not limited to these components, as any components may sit within the `TopBar` to create a flexible and custom UI.

By default, `TopBar` uses a flex layout with flex items placed immediately after each other. To align flex items, an optional css prop with `justifyContent` can be passed.

Alternatively, if you want to avoid wrapping groups of items with a `div` purely for alignment purposes, you could use a spacer. In this example, the styling of the `Flex` component has been extended so that it stretches to fill the available space.

```tsx preview
<TopBar>
  <TopBar.Brand href="atomlearning.co.uk">
    <Text>Admin Panel</Text>
  </TopBar.Brand>
  <Flex css={{ flex: 1, justifySelf: 'stretch', alignSelf: 'stretch' }} />
  <Stack gap="2" direction="row">
    <TopBar.ActionIcon icon={Search} label="Search" />
    <TopBar.Divider />
    <TopBar.ActionIcon icon={SwitchOff} label="Light/Dark mode" />
  </Stack>
</TopBar>
```

## TopBar.Brand

`TopBar.Brand` renders a link with the Atom Logo, any children passed will be rendered to the right alongside the logo.

## TopBar.ActionIcon

`TopBar.ActionIcon` extends the base `ActionIcon` component with some additional styles.
Note that instead of needing to include a seperate `Icon` component as children, an icon can be passed directly to this component as a prop.
