description: Stepper provides a bullet list of steps and forward/backwards navigation buttons.
category: Navigation

`Stepper` exports multiple components that combine to create a stepped progress view.

`Stepper.StepBack` represents the backwards navigation element. It can receive either a child text node or a `label` prop as a function that receives `activeStep` as an argument in order to possibly render different labels based on the current step the user is on. It is automatically disabled while the user is viewing the first step.

`Stepper.StepForward` represents the forward navigation element. It can receive either a child text node or a `label` prop as a function that receives `activeStep` as an argument in order to possibly render different labels based on the current step the user is on. It can receive an onClick prop to override its default behaviour in case some logic or validation needs to be applied before going to the next step.

`Stepper.Steps` holds the actual bullet list. It can receive a `css` prop, allowing for full customization.

The root `Stepper` component must be passed `stepCount` as a number in order to display the desired number of bullet steps. It also takes `onStepChange` as a function that takes `activeStep` as an argument. This can be used to determine what content to display, based on the current step. It can also take `onComplete` as a function that gets called when the user clicks the `StepForward` button while on the last step.

```tsx preview
<Stepper stepCount={3}>
  <Stepper.StepBack>Back</Stepper.StepBack>
  <Stepper.Steps />
  <Stepper.StepForward>Next</Stepper.StepForward>
</Stepper>
```

The root `Stepper` component can also take an `allowSkip` prop that allows the user to navigate by clicking the actual bullets. However, navigating by clicking a bullet is only possible if the user has already viewed it by using the `Next` button.

Below is a more complex example that shows how to dynamically render the button labels, get the activeStep in order to potentially use it to determine what content to render based on the current position, and use an `onComplete` function to trigger custom behaviour when the user reaches the final step.

```tsx preview
<Stepper
  stepCount={3}
  allowSkip
  onComplete={() => console.log('Finished')}
  onStepChange={(activeStep) =>
    console.log('Do something with the active step')
  }
>
  <Stepper.StepBack label={(activeStep) => 'Back'} />
  <Stepper.Steps css={{ width: '200px' }} />
  <Stepper.StepForward
    label={(activeStep) => (activeStep === 2 ? 'Finish' : 'Next')}
  />
</Stepper>
```

Below is how to override the forward default behavior if some logic or validation need to be done before moving to the next step

```tsx preview
<Stepper stepCount={3}>
  <Stepper.StepBack>Back</Stepper.StepBack>
  <Stepper.Steps />
  <Stepper.StepForward
    onClick={(goToNextStep) => {
      // do something before
      goToNextStep()
    }}
  >
    Next
  </Stepper.StepForward>
</Stepper>
```

The root `Stepper` component also allows the user to pass a `step` prop in order to render step labels. When the `step` prop is passed, the `Stepper` component will be used as a controlled component thereby taking control of its state. When used as a controlled component, navigation across steps, and identifying the state of a step would be controlled by the array of steps passed to the component.

Below is an example that shows how to use the controlled component. Each object in the `steps` array must include a `label` and a `status` property to determine what content to render based on the current position.

```tsx preview
<Stepper
  steps={[
    {
      label: 'Step 1',
      status: 'viewed'
    },
    {
      label: 'Step 2',
      status: 'active'
    }
  ]}
>
  <Stepper.Steps css={{ width: '200px' }} />
</Stepper>
```

The root `Stepper` component also allows the user to pass a `orientation` prop in order to the alternate the component direction .

Below is an example that shows how to render steps in vertical direction.

```tsx preview
<Stepper stepCount={2} orientation="vertical">
  <Stepper.Steps css={{ width: '200px' }} />
</Stepper>
```
