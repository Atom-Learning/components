`SearchField` is the preferred way to render a form field for search inputs.

In addition to text `Label` (required) and a validation error (optional), `SearchField` accepts all the same props as `SearchInput` and will pass them on to the `SearchInput` it renders. However, as with all our composed components,
`SearchField`’s `css` prop will be applied to a containing `Box`—the styling of the individual components inside `SearchField` cannot be altered.

Err on the side of using consistent form fields, but if you really need something with different styling then consider composing your own field from the
`SearchInput`, `Label` and `InlineMessage` components.

```tsx preview
<Form>
  <SearchField
    name="Email address"
    label="Email address"
    placeholder="your.name@example.com"
    type="email"
    css={{ width: 320 }}
  />
</Form>
```
