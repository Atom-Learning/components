title: Number Input
component: NumberInput
description: The NumberInput component is similar to the Input component, but it has controls for incrementing or decrementing numeric values.
category: Form primitives
---

`NumberInput` wraps `Input` set to a numeric value, along with two `ActionIcon` buttons for decrementing and incrementing the value.

```tsx preview
<NumberInput name="age" />
```

When min or max values are set, the corresponding decrement or increment button will become disabled when the min/max values are reached. By default, min is set to 0.

A tooltip will display on hover of a disabled button, providing information on why the button is disabled. To override the default tooltip content, pass in a `disabledTooltipContent` object.

Note: A `<ToolTipProvider />` must be rendered at the root of the app for this to work.

```tsx preview
<NumberInput
  name="age"
  max={11}
  disabledTooltipContent={{ increment: 'Ages over 11 are not allowed' }}
/>
```

## Keyboard interactions

A negative `tabindex` has been added to the increment and decrement buttons to remove them from the default tabbing order. Instead, users can use the below keys to interact with the component.

- When you hit the ⬆️ or ➡️ key, the input value will be increased by step.
- When you hit the ⬅️ or ⬇️ key, the input value will be decreased by step.
- When you hit the Home button, the value will jump to the min value.
- When you hit the End button, the value will jump to the max value.
