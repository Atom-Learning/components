`BulkActionsBar` can be used with tables or lists to show the actions that can be done in bulk in the selected items.
The actions are split between main actions that are always visible as buttons and other actions that are visible inside a dropdown.
By default `BulkActionsBar` shows a cancel button that should be used to cancel the selection.

```jsx preview
<BulkActionsBar
  label="1 item selected - Sorted by session name"
  cancelLabel="Cancel"
  onCancel={() => {}}
>
  <BulkActionsBar.Action
    icon={Edit}
    text="Edit"
    onClick={() => {}}
    isMain
  />
  <BulkActionsBar.Action
    icon={Bolt}
    text="Other action"
    onClick={() => {}}
  />
</BulkActionsBar>
```

## Actions

`BulkActionsBar.Action` displays a button or a dropdown item depending on the property `isMain`. 
Main actions will be displayed as visible buttons in the bar and moved to the dropdown on small screens while other actions will always be displayed in the dropdown
