The NotificationBadge component is a lightweight wrapper for content such as ActionIcons, but can be wrapped around any block-level element.

It displays a badge in top right of the content it is wrapping, which displays a `value` passed in as a prop. This could be, for example, the number of filters selected on a select filters badge.

```tsx preview
<NotificationBadge value={3}>
  <ActionIcon appearance="outline" size="lg" isRounded>
    <Icon is={Controls} />
  </ActionIcon>
</NotificationBadge>
```

## Value

Whilst you would normally want to display a number, the `value` prop also supports strings. Here are some usage examples:

```tsx preview
<>
  <NotificationBadge value={88}>
    <ActionIcon appearance="outline" size="lg">
      <Icon is={Controls} />
    </ActionIcon>
  </NotificationBadge>
  <NotificationBadge value="hi">
    <Button theme="warning">I'm a button!</Button>
  </NotificationBadge>
</>
```
