`DataTable` provides complex features for tables, like sorting and pagination. It's built around the `@tanstack/react-table` library and exposes the `table` state from that library directly. All util functions from the library are also compatible with `DataTable`. It's worth a good read of [`@tanstack/react-table`'s documentation](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/introduction) too, since we won't be repeating much of it here.

`DataTable` and its subcomponents are designed to be very simple to use. This is achieved by abstracting complex and/or boilerplate logic away from the consumer. For example, `DataTable.Pagination` can be dropped inside a `DataTable` to paginate the table's data without the need to add any configuration on `DataTable` itself. This is achieved by having `DataTable.Pagination` itself use the `applyPagination` and `setPageSize` methods exposed by `useDataTable` on its first render. This pattern should be replicated wherever practical to maintain the best developer experience possible.

## Anatomy

The root `DataTable` component manages the table's state and exposes it via the React Context API. This state can be accessed by any child components by calling `useDataTable`.

Other `DataTable` components use `useDataTable` and provide useful default behaviours for different functionality. If they don't meet your requirements, you can build your own implementation by calling `useDataTable` in a new component yourself. If your use case is a common one, please make a PR to add the component to the library.

### Using defaults vs using rolling your own

Here's a simple config for some table data and columns.

```tsx
import { createColumnHelper } from '@tanstack/react-table'

const columnHelper = createColumnHelper<{
  name: string
  hobby: string
}>()

const columns = [
  columnHelper.accessor('name', {
    cell: (info) => info.getValue()
  }),
  columnHelper.accessor('hobby', {
    cell: (info) => info.getValue()
  }),
  // Columns created with columnHelper.display won't get be sortable.
  // They need a header to be set manually since they're not just reading
  // a property from the row.
  columnHelper.display({
    cell: (info) => <button>do something</button>,
    header: 'Actions'
  })
]

const data = [
  { name: 'chrissy', hobby: 'bare-knuckle boxing' },
  { name: 'agatha', hobby: 'crossfit' },
  { name: 'betty', hobby: 'acting' }
]
```

There are basically two ways to use `DataTable` to build a table from this config. The first uses the highest-level components that are bundled into `DataTable` to provide useful default behaviours with minimal code. The second directly accesses the state from `DataTable` and combines it with the `Table` UI components to achieve the same thing. This demonstrates how you could create more custom table UIs without the need to extend the high-level components.

#### With Defaults

The following two examples are exactly equivalent in their output. The second example is included to demonstrate what `DataTable`'s subcomponents do: they bundle up UI components and logic to provide useful defaults. They exist at various levels of abstraction, e.g. `DataTable.Table` renders `DataTable.Body`, which renders `DataTable.Row`. This means that you can use whichever component provides useful functionality for your use case while still being low-level enough to let you combine it with your own custom logic.

```tsx
<DataTable columns={columns} data={data}>
  <DataTable.Table userSortable />
  <DataTable.Pagination pageSize={5} />
</DataTable>

<DataTable columns={columns} data={data}>
  <Table>
    <DataTable.Head userSortable />
    <DataTable.Body />
  </Table>
  <DataTable.Pagination pageSize={5} />
</DataTable>
```

### Rolling your own

Note that `useDataTable` can only be called by a child component of `DataTable.Provider`. In a real example, you'll probably have a separate named component which makes the `useDataTable` call, because if you're not using the defaults as above then you probably have some complex logic involved. In this example we've got an inline child component for simplicity.

```tsx
<DataTable.Provider columns={columns} data={data}>
  {() => {
    const { getHeaderGroups, getRowModel } = useDataTable()

    return (
      <Table>
        <Table.Header>
          {getHeaderGroups().map((headerGroup) => (
            <Table.Row key={headerGroup.id}>
              {headerGroup.headers.map((header) => {
                const sort = header.column.getIsSorted()
                return (
                  <Table.HeaderCell
                    onClick={header.column.getToggleSortingHandler()}
                    {...props}
                  >
                    {flexRender(
                      header.column.columnDef.header,
                      header.getContext()
                    )}
                    {sort && { asc: '^', desc: 'v' }[sort as string]}
                  </Table.HeaderCell>
                )
              })}
            </Table.Row>
          ))}
        </Table.Header>
        <Table.Body>
          {getRowModel().rows.map((row) => (
            <Table.Row>
              {row.getVisibleCells().map((cell) => (
                <Table.Cell key={cell.id}>
                  {flexRender(cell.column.columnDef.cell, cell.getContext())}
                </Table.Cell>
              ))}
            </Table.Row>
          ))}
        </Table.Body>
      </Table>
      // Then you could build your own pagination here too I guess? If you really wanted to?
    )
  }}
</DataTable.Provider>
```

## Features

### Sorting

A `DataTable`'s data can be sorted by default and can also be sortable by the user. These two options are independent of each other.

#### Default sorting

`DataTable` takes an optional `defaultSort` prop to configure the column and direction for the table's default sorting, e.g. `{column: 'name', direction: 'asc'}`

#### User sorting

If `DataTable`'s `userSortable` state is `true`, then `DataTable.Header` will be clickable to toggle between ascending, descending and no sorting in any sortable columns. `DataTable.Head` and `DataTable.Table` take an optional boolean `userSortable` prop to configure this option.

### Pagination

`DataTable.Pagination` can be passed as a child to `DataTable.Provider` to render the pagination UI and configure the parent `DataTable.Provider` to paginate its data.
