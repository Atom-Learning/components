Functionality based on the [`Accordion`](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion) radix component.

Implements experimental ColorScheme component to allow multiple colour setups.

The Accordion exports 4 components that combine to make the `Accordion`. The parent Accordion contains `Accordion.Item` components, which themselves must contain `Accordion.Trigger` and `Accordion.Content`.

The `Accordion.Trigger` has been simplified to include a chevron icon. Generally, you would only want to render text inside the rest.

Default styling has been applied to `Accordion.Trigger`, but `Accordion.Content` is an empty container without styling. Should only text be placed inside, it is highly advisable to apply spacing to align with the styling of the rest of the Accordion. This can be done with either the `css` property, or by placing any other components inside the `Accordion.Content`.

```tsx preview
<Accordion type="single" defaultValue="1">
  <Accordion.Item value="1">
    <Accordion.Trigger>Accordion Header 1</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content css={{ p: '$3' }}>
      <Text>Accordion content 1</Text>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="2">
    <Accordion.Trigger>Accordion Header 2</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content css={{ p: '$3' }}>
      <Text>Accordion content 2</Text>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

## Values

Each `Accordion.Item` must have a value, which can either be used as a `defaultValue` on the Accordion, or by setting the `value` of the Accordion so it is a controlled component. If value is set, it must also contain an `onValueChange` function that sets the value to a new value.

## Collapsible

Accordions can be given the property `collapsible`, which allows all items to be collapsed. Without passing this at least one item must be open.

## Type

Accordions can have `type` as either `single` or `multiple`. This changes how many items can be expanded at once. The default is `single`.

Note: if `multiple`, `value` and `defaultValue` must be in an array. Even if you want just one item to be visible initially, you must pass something like `defaultValue={['name']}`

## Disabled

An `Accordion.Item` component can take a `disabled` prop, which would make it untoggleable.
The corresponding `Accordion.Content` component's content will be, in this case, permanently in its original state.

```tsx preview live
<Accordion type="single" defaultValue="1">
  <Accordion.Item value="1" disabled>
    <Accordion.Trigger>Accordion Header 1</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content css={{ p: '$3' }}>
      <Text>Accordion content 1</Text>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="2">
    <Accordion.Trigger>Accordion Header 2</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content css={{ p: '$3' }}>
      <Text>Accordion content 2</Text>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

## Color Scheme

You can pass in a `colorScheme` object to the Accordion.Trigger to customise the colours of the component.
Defaults to `{ accent: "slate", interactive: "loContrast1"}`
ColorScheme is experimental and has been implemented only locally but you can read more about how it
currently works and available options [on the repository's github](https://github.com/Atom-Learning/components/tree/main/color-scheme#readme).

```tsx preview live
<Accordion type="single" defaultValue="1">
  <Accordion.Item value="1">
    <Accordion.Trigger
      colorScheme={{
        accent: 'blue',
        interactive: 'hiContrast2'
      }}
    >
      Accordion Header 1
    </Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content css={{ p: '$3' }}>
      <Text>Accordion content 1</Text>
    </Accordion.Content>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```
