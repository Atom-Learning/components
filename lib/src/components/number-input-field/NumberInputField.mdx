`NumberInputField` is the preferred way to render a form field for a number input.

In addition to text `Label` (required) and a validation error (optional), `NumberInputField` accepts all the same props as `NumberInput` and will pass them on to the `NumberInput` it renders.

```tsx preview
<Form>
  <NumberInputField
    label="Number of cats"
    name="cats"
    min={3}
    validation={{
      min: {
        value: 3,
        message: 'You must have at least 3 cats!'
      }
    }}
  />
</Form>
```
