      [Input](/components/input)


      <br/>


      `InputField` is the preferred way to render a form field for single-line text and number data.


      In addition to text `Label` (required) and a validation error (optional), `InputField` accepts all the same props as `Input` and will pass them on to the `Input` it renders. However, as with all our composed components, `InputField`’s `css` prop will be applied to a containing `Box`—the styling of the individual components inside `InputField` cannot be altered.


      Err on the side of using consistent form fields, but if you really need something with different styling then consider composing your own field from the `Input`, `Label` and `InlineMessage` components.


      <CodeBlock live={true} preview={true} code={`<Form>
        <InputField
          name="Email address"
          label="Email address"
          placeholder="your.name@example.com"
          type="email"
          css={{ width: 320 }}
        />
      </Form>`} language={"tsx"} />

      ## States


      Inputs involve different states that will help users easily detect what’s expected from them. Placeholders provide examples, focus makes the selected input stand out in a form and error states easily guide the user through the step to complete in order to move on.
