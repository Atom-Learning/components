      [Phone number field](/components/phone-number-field)


      <br/>


      A form component that provides a styled international phone number input with a country selector.


      Phone number inputs should be accompanied by labels, so rather than using `PhoneNumberInput` directly in a UI, it’s normally best to the `PhoneNumberField` component, which combines a `PhoneNumberInput` with a `Label` and displays validation errors. Alternatively, use this `PhoneNumberInput` component to compose other field components with more specific requirements.


      `PhoneNumberInput` uses  [](https://github.com/deseretdigital/dayzed)[react-phone-number-input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-phone-number-input) under the hood, so further reading on the API can be found there. Some options are set by default in order to provide a uniform experience.
