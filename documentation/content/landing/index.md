      Welcome to the Atom Learning design system


      ![badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@atom-learning/components) ![badge](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Atom-Learning/components/Test%20&%20validate) ![badge](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@atom-learning/components)


      The design system is divided up into three main parts:


      * A set of rules & guidelines for applying the system within the context of Atom Learning

      * Information on the theme layer and underlying visual system that powers the design-system

      * Technical documentation on our component library


      Our main focus for this initial release has been to create the in-depth technical documentation for our [component library](https://design.atomlearning.technology/components/introduction). There is also an initial draft of the [theme](https://design.atomlearning.technology/theme/colours) content written, for use mainly as a visual reference for the scales and systems that form our design system. We also have a [gallery view](https://design.atomlearning.technology/components) of all our components in one place.


      We're aiming to add a number of guidelines soon that talk not only about the components and how to use them, but also how best to combine them and use them in context for a greater user experience. We hope to include detailed guidance on more specific UX patterns like data capture through forms, consistent navigation patterns, tone of voice, how to best handle error & empty states, how to prioritise interface elements, and others.


      The underlying source code for the design system is spread across three repositories:


      * [atom-learning/components](https://github.com/Atom-Learning/components) contains our React component library code

      * [atom-learning/theme](https://github.com/Atom-Learning/theme) contains our design tokens and the transformations for JS and Sass

      * [atom-learning/icons](https://github.com/Atom-Learning/icons) contains our React SVG icon system


      We welcome feedback so please provide comments or bug reports on our [Github repository](https://github.com/Atom-Learning/components/issues).
