      `PasswordInput` wraps `Input` with a content visibility toggle, triggered by interaction with an eye Icon.


      For most use cases it is better to use `PasswordField`, which includes a label, hooks into our `Form` component and shows validation errors where appropriate. Only use `PasswordInput` if you need to compose something that behaves differently to the `PasswordField` and be sure to include a label manually.
