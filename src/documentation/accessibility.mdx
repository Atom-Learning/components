description: We aim to adhere to strict accessibility standards with AA as the minimum.

To enable this, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` is set to strict mode. Different tools are used to validate the components as each serves a different purpose. The accessibility unit tests will fail the pipeline and prevent releasing inaccessible components. **_However, these tests are only valid with the context they are testing on, so they can't guarantee 100% that a component is fully accessible._** Therefore, manual testing is required along with design validation.

Before developing a component, please take some time to read the following sections and the reading provided.

## Things to consider whilst developing

- Using `React.Fragment` where possible to avoid adding extra `<div>`
  > Sometimes we break HTML semantics when we add `<div>` elements to our JSX to make our React code work, especially when working with lists (`<ol>`, `<ul>` and `<dl>`) and the HTML `<table>`. In these cases we should rather use React Fragments to group together multiple elements. for examples please look at the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html)
- Add unit tests to test accessibility
  Add an accessibility unit test (using the `jest-axe`) to ensure that the components' different variations don't have any accessibility issues. Example:

```jsx
it('has no programmatically detectable a11y issues', async () => {
  render(<Flex />, document.body)
  const results = await axe(document.body)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

_Note:_ `axe` doesn't catch contrast issues when run on `jsdom` which `jest` is using.

- Using the React Testing Library rules into adopting a user-centric testing an approach. [Priority](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority)
  - Test real interactions
  - Verify the perceivable results
- Always validating any concerns with the design team
- Manually test complex components for keyboard navigation

## Things to consider whilst consuming the library

As mentioned above, accessibility testing is heavily reliant on the context, so when using the Design System in an app, please consider the following:

- Testing the components for accessibility in the context of where they are used
- Testing the entire page for at least the following:
  - contrast issues
  - keyboard navigation
  - autofocus
  - general accesibility issues
- Always raising concerns to the design team
