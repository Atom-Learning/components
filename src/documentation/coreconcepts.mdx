These components are intended to provide an abstraction over HTML elements and interactive components, providing an interface to ease creation of user interfaces in React. This library isn't comprehensive, but it should provide enough primitive, low-level components to be able to easily create pages, layouts, content, forms, as well as using them to compose more complex components with additional logic.

Each component in the design system is built from a `styled()` function and this gives them access to a series of common props.

## as

To apply the correct semantic element to one of our components, you can use `as` and pass in a string HTML element. For example, when using the `Heading` component you can pass in `h3` to use that element.

```jsx
<Heading as="h3">Hello World</Heading>
```

```html
<h3>Hello World</h3>
```

Some components have a restricted set of valid elements to pass into `as`, for example, `Heading` only allows `h1` through to `h6`, and some components remove the ability to change the HTML element altogether, like `<Select />` or `<Icon />`, which require a certain element to work correctly.

Each of these restrictions are detailed on the component documentation under `API Reference`.

## css

The `css` prop is available on all of our components to allow you to style them. You can pass in an object of CSS key value pairs and the component will apply those styles as a class on the rendered component.

The benefit of using the `css` prop as opposed to writing inline styles is that we can directly access values from our design tokens, write responsive styles, and use practical shorthand utilities for applying style.

```jsx
<Box
  css={{
    // we can write standard CSS here
    fontFamily: 'Arial',
    color: 'red',

    // we can also access tokens that are mapped to CSS properties
    backgroundColor: '$primary500',
    padding: '$3',

    // write inline responsive styles
    when: {
      lg: { color: 'blue' },
      '@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)': { color: 'white' }
    },

    // and utilise shorthand utilities
    mb: '$3',
    size: 30
  }}
/>
```

`@atom-learning/components` also exports the underlying `styled()` function that was used to create these components, refer to the [Stitches page](/components/stitches) to read more about the difference between `css` and `styled()`. You can also read more about our shorthand utilities and other default configuration options.

### Tokens

[Stitches](https://stitches.dev) uses the [System UI](https://system-ui.com/theme/) theme specification to map named values to their corresponding CSS property. You can read more about this and see the full token set by referring to the [tokens reference](/theme/tokens).

As a quick example, our tokens come in two main forms, values and scales.

For a layout property like `padding` or `margin`, the token represents the nth value on the spacing scale, e.g. `padding: '$2'` will render `padding: '8px'`.

For a property like `color`, it will look up the `colors` tokens and will use the value directly, e.g. `color: '$warning'` will render `color: 'hsl(24 ,100%, 55%)'`.
