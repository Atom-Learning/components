As the design system evolves, we are going to need to keep contributing to keep the system up to date with the designs and fill out any gaps.

Here is a list of pending component or variants that need to be added to the library. If you spot something you need on this list please, create an PR to add it and then remove it from here:

| Component Name     | Usage                                               | Issue                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Enhanced Table  | Wraps the basic table with pagination and filtering |                                                        |
| 2. Bulletless List | Adds a list without bullet decoration               | https://github.com/Atom-Learning/components/issues/131 |

Note: sometime components might already exist in the code base, so asking other teams before building might help save time.
