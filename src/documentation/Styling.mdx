To read about Stitches in more depth you can refer to the [official documentation](https://stitches.dev/), the information provided here is mainly focused on the choices we made to configure Stitches for the component library.

`@atom-learning/components` exports not only a collection of React components built with Stitches but also the full Stitches library to allow full use of `styled()` and other related methods. This enables you to write more complex components with variants, typed tokens, descendant selectors, keyframe animations and more, some of which are unavailable when using `css`.

When creating a new component alongside the component library we recommend that you utilise the `styled()` function to maintain a consistent component API. This will automatically provide `as` and `css` to the user without any extra configuration, in a way that `<Box />` or another generic layout component wouldn't.

## Utilities

Stitches enables you to create shorthand utilities to improve the CSS authoring experience within `styled()` or `css`. We have provided an initial set of utilities that should be a useful starting point when composing components with a need to provide contextual layout or styles.

A quick example using `bg` and `size` to create a little blue square.

```tsx preview
<Box css={{ bg: '$primary200', size: 100 }} />
```

The full list of utilities can be found in the [components repository](https://github.com/Atom-Learning/components/blob/main/src/stitches.ts#L8-L72)

## Media Queries / Conditions

Stitches also has responsive styles built into its API, we've provided an initial set of mobile-first breakpoints alongside feature queries like `prefers-reduced-motion`.

```ts
export const conditions = {
  sm: '@media (min-width: 550px)',
  md: '@media (min-width: 800px)',
  lg: '@media (min-width: 1100px)',
  xl: '@media (min-width: 1350px)',
  reducedMotion: '@media (prefers-reduced-motion)',
  hover: '@media (hover: hover)'
}
```

You can use these in `styled()` or `css` by prefixing the key with `@`, e.g. `@reducedMotion` or `@xl`

```tsx
const Section = styled('section', {
  padding: '$2',
  '@md': { padding: '$3' }
})
```

```tsx
<Text
  css={{
    color: '$tonal900',
    '@md': { color: '$primary500' },
    '@lg': { color: '$secondary700' }
  }}
>
  Hello World
</Text>
```

You can also use them to switch [variants](https://stitches.dev/docs/variants)

```tsx
<Button
  // change the 'theme' to 'secondary' when you trigger the 'md' breakpoint
  theme={{ '@initial': 'primary', '@md': 'secondary' }}
  // change the 'size' to 'md' when you trigger the 'sm' breakpoint
  size: {{ '@initial': 'sm', '@sm': 'md' }}
>
  Click me
</Button>
```
