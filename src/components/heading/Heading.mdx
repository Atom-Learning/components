# Heading

`Heading` is our fundamental heading component. It should be used for all headings, whether it's for a page, `section`, card, etc.

`Heading`'s `as` prop defaults to `h2` but accepts `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`.
Follow [semantic HTML guidelines](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/) when deciding which element to use. Also note that the size of a heading is controlled
separately to which element is used.

## Sizes

### sm

<Heading size="sm">
  A heading for an individual block of content, e.g. a card
</Heading>

### md

<Heading>A subheading in a page. This is the default size.</Heading>

### lg

<Heading size="large">A page heading.</Heading>
