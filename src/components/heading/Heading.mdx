It should be used for all headings, whether it's for a page, `section`, card, etc.

`Heading`'s `as` prop defaults to `h2` but also accepts `h1`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`. Follow [semantic HTML guidelines](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/) when deciding which element to use. Also note that the size of a heading is controlled separately to which element is used.

## Sizes

```tsx preview
<Heading size="xs">The lowest level heading</Heading>
```

```tsx preview
<Heading size="sm">
  A heading for an individual block of content, e.g. a card
</Heading>
```

```tsx preview
<Heading>A subheading in a page. This is the default size.</Heading>
```

```tsx preview
<Heading size="lg">A page heading.</Heading>
```
