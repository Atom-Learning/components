category: Layout

The component provides a set of default styles, which can be overwritten by using the `css` prop. It is composed by combining smallar components, such as `TabTriggerList`, `TabTrigger`, and `TabContent`.

```tsx preview
<Tabs defaultValue="tab1" css={{ height: '400px', border: '1px solid black' }}>
  <TabTriggerList css={{ borderBottom: '1px solid gray' }}>
    <TabTrigger value="tab1">
      <Text>Nested component under the TabTrigger component</Text>
    </TabTrigger>
    <TabTrigger value="tab2">Simple text</TabTrigger>
  </TabTriggerList>
  <TabContent value="tab1">Content for tab1.</TabContent>
  <TabContent value="tab2">
    Content for the second tab. It can also hold other components, like a{' '}
    <Button>Button</Button>
  </TabContent>
</Tabs>
```

## TabTriggerList

The `TabTriggerList` component simply holds the individual `TabTrigger` components. It can also get custom styling via the `css` prop.

```tsx preview
<Tabs>
  <TabTriggerList>
    <TabTrigger>Tab 1</TabTrigger>
    <TabTrigger>Tab 2</TabTrigger>
    <TabTrigger>Tab 3</TabTrigger>
  </TabTriggerList>
</Tabs>
```

## TabTrigger

The `TabTrigger` component holds the content that will be displayed inside the button that the user would click in order to switch tabs. In can hold either a string, or some other component. It needs to be passed a `value` prop, that would be identical to the `value` prop passed to its corresponding `TabContent` component.

```tsx preview
<TabTrigger value='tab1'>Tab 1</TabTrigger>
<TabTrigger value='tab2'><Text>Tab 2</Text></TabTrigger>
```

## TabContent

The `TabContent` component, as the name suggests, holds the content for that particular section of the tabs component. It takes a `value` prop that needs to match the `value` prop passed to its corresponding trigger. Its content can be any text or valid component.

```tsx preview
<TabContent value="tab2">
  Content for the second tab. It can also hold other components, like a{' '}
  <Button>Button</Button>
</TabContent>
```

## Disabled tab

A `TabTrigger` component can take a `disabled` prop, which would make it unselectable. The corresponding `TabContent` component's content will be, in this case, permanently hidden.

```tsx preview
<TabTrigger disabled value="tab1">
  Tab 1
</TabTrigger>
```

## Styling the `TabTrigger`

In order to style the different states of a trigger, the following CSS selectors need to be used when passed to the `css` prop:

`&:hover` to style the hover state of the trigger.
`&[data-disabled]` to style a disabled trigger.
`&[data-disabled]:hover` to style a disabled trigger's hover state.
`&[data-state="active"]` to style an active trigger.

If the content of the trigger is, say, a `Text` component instead of a string, you can append the `*` symbol or any other child/sibling selectors, to make sure that any nested content is styled accordingly.
