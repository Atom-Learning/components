Inputs should be accompanied by labels, so rather than using `Input` directly in a UI,
itâ€™s normally best to use a field component, which combines an `Input` with a `Label` and
displays validation errors. If none of the existing field components suit your needs,
it might be worth adding a new one.

`Input` accepts a subset of the `types` that an HTML `input` element because we have more specialised
components for the others (e.g. `Checkbox`, `Radio`).

```tsx live
<Input placeholder="Placeholder text" css={{ width: 300 }} />
```

## Accessibility

While `Input` accepts `"number"` for its `type` prop, this does not render `<input type="number"/>`. Instead,
it renders `<input type="text" inputmode="numeric" pattern=[0-9]*/>` to tell browsers to show a numeric keyboard
while avoiding the [UX and accessibility problems associated with `type="number"`](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/).
