## General

`Form` is a wrapper around an HTML `form` element and the `react-hook-form` library. It manages the `useForm()` instance and handles the validation logic. When validation happens depends on the `validationMode` prop, which accepts `"onBlur" | "onSubmit"` and defaults to `"onBlur"`.

`Form` is compatible with all our field components (i.e. `InputField`, not `Input`) and is also compatible with custom fields so long as they accept the following props:

- `error`: `string` (for validation errors)
- `register`: `(validation: ValidationOptions) => React.ForwardedRef<HTML*Element>` (e.g. `React.ForwardedRef<HTMLInputElement>` or `React.ForwardedRef<HTMLSelectElement>` depending on what your field renders.)
- `validation`: `ValidationOptions`

## ValidationOptions

The `ValidationOptions` type provides preset logic for common validation and processing patterns. You can also define your own custom logic.

### Basic validation

The `required` property accepts a `message` and a `value`. `value` is a boolean that represents whether the field is required. That pattern is only necessary when
deciding dynamically whether to make a field required. If it will always be required, you can pass a `string` containing the error message instead. The following two inputs are equivalent:

```tsx center
<Form>
  <InputField name="name" label="Name" validation={{required: {value: true, message: "You must have a name"}}} />
  <InputField name="name" label="Name" validation={{required: "You must have a name"} />
  <Button>Submit</Button>
</Form>
```

If a field is set to be required in this way, the component will also be passed a `required` boolean prop automatically, so that's what our fields use to determine whether or not
to show an asterisk next to the label.

The following properties take a `message` and a `value`:

- `min`
- `max`
- `minLength`
- `maxLength`
- `pattern`

For example:

```tsx center
<Form>
  <InputField type="number" name="numCats" label="Number of cats" validation={{min: {value: 3, message: "You must have at least 3 cats!"}}}/>
  <InputField name="faveName" label="Favourite cat name" validation={{maxLength: {{value: 20, message: "Cats hate long names!"}}}} />
  <Button>Submit</Button>
</Form>
```

Note that when specifying a `pattern`, the `value` is a `RegExp`. For the other basic properties listed here, `value` is a `number`.

### Custom validation

The `validate` property accepts a function of type `(value: any) => boolean | string`. Its single argument is the current value of the field. It should return `true` if the value passes validation and a `string` containing an error if not.

```tsx center
<Form>
  <InputField
    name="faveVowel"
    label="Favourite vowel"
    validation={{
      validate: (value) =>
        ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'].contains(value) || "That's not a vowel!"
    }}
  />
  <Button>Submit</Button>
</Form>
```

### Basic processing

The following properties accept boolean values:

- `valueAsNumber`
- `valueAsDate`

These properties only apply to text inputs. If `true`, the value will be converted to the relevant type after validation.

### Custom processing

The `process` property accepts a function of type `(value: any) => any`. It can be used to process the value after validation.

## Composing form field components

It's easy to compose your own custom form fields from the low-level components in this library (`Input`, `Label`, `ValidationError` etc) but there are some requirements that your new
field must meet in order to be fully compatible with our `Form`.

### Props

Your custom form field component must take the props specified in [General](#General)

#### error

`error` should be displayed in a `ValidationError` when present. You don't need to pass `error` to your component manually; the `Form` will pass it in automatically when appropriate.

#### validation

`validation` allows users of your component to add custom validation rules to it as specified above

#### register

If you don't need to add any default validation to your component, then pass `register?.(validation)` down to the `Input` (or `Select`, etc) component's `ref` prop.
If you do want to add default validation, pass something like this: `register?.({ maxLength: {value: 2, message: "short data only!" },...validation })` (but check that `validation is truthy first, or default it to an empty object!). Note that optional chaining is important here to protect from runtime errors if your field gets rendered outside of a `Form`.

### Examples

Here are two email input field examples. The first is a wrapper around an `InputField` and the second is manually composed from lower-level components. If wrapping `InputField` is an option then you should take it,
but for more complex use cases you can use the manual composition here as a guide.

```tsx
const EmailField = ({ name, register, error, validation = {}, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <InputField
      name={name}
      css={{ mb: '$3' }}
      autoComplete="email"
      label="Email address"
      type="email"
      register={register}
      validation={{
        required: 'email address is required',
        pattern: {
          value: /.+@.+\..+/,
          message: 'please enter a valid email address'
        },
        ...validation
      }}
      error={error}
      {...rest}
    />
  )
}
```

```tsx
const EmailField = ({
  css = {},
  name,
  error = null,
  register = null,
  validation = {},
  required,
  ...rest
}) => (
  <Box css={css}>
    <Label required={required} css={{ mb: '$2' }}>
      Email
    </Label>
    <Input
      autoComplete="email"
      label="Email address"
      name={name}
      type="email"
      ref={register?.({
        required: 'email address is required',
        pattern: {
          value: /.+@.+\..+/,
          message: 'please enter a valid email address'
        },
        ...validation
      })}
      error={error}
      {...rest}
    />
    {error && <ValidationError css={{ mt: '$1' }}>{error}</ValidationError>}
  </Box>
)
```
