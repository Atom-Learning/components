The `Flex` component is analagous to `Box` but additionally sets the rendering context of its children to `display: flex`.

```tsx preview
<Flex css={{ justifyContent: 'space-between', width: '100%' }}>
  <Box css={{ bg: '$primary200', size: '$6' }} />
  <Box css={{ bg: '$primary200', size: '$6' }} />
  <Box css={{ bg: '$primary200', size: '$6' }} />
</Flex>
```
