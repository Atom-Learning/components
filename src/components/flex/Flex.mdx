title: Flex
component: Flex

The `Flex` component is analagous to `Box` but additionally sets the rendering context of its children to `display: flex`.

```jsx preview
<Flex as="aside" css={{ justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <Text>Hello from the left!</Text>
  <Text>Hello from the right!</Text>
</Flex>
```
