# Flex

The `Flex` component is analagous to `Box` but additionally sets the rendering context of its children to `display: flex`.

```jsx
<Flex as="aside" css={{ justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <Box css={{ bg: '$tonal200', p: '$2' }}>Hello from the left!</Box>
  <Box css={{ bg: '$tonal200', p: '$2' }}>Hello from the right!</Box>
</Flex>
```
