`Flex` shares the same API as `Box`, so you can access `as` and `css` to apply the correct semantic element and contextually relevant styles.

```tsx preview
<Flex css={{ justifyContent: 'space-between', width: '100%' }}>
  <Box css={{ bg: '$primary', size: '$6' }} />
  <Box css={{ bg: '$primary', size: '$6' }} />
  <Box css={{ bg: '$primary', size: '$6' }} />
</Flex>
```
