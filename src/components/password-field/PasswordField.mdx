`PasswordField` is the preferred way to render a form field for a current password (not necessarily for creating a new password).

`PasswordField` accepts the same props as `InputField` but provides default values for some of them (e.g. `label` defaults to `"Password"` and `name` defaults to `password`).

In addition to the regular `InputField` props and functionality, `PasswordField` accepts an optional `forgotPasswordURL` prop which will be used to render a link to a password reset page. It also provides the ability for the user to toggle visibility of their password.

```jsx live
<PasswordField
  prompt={{ link: '/forgot-password', label: 'Forgotten your password?' }}
  placeholder="Your password"
  css={{ width: 340 }}
/>
```
