Textareas should be accompanied by labels, so rather than using `Textarea` directly in a UI, it's normally best to use a `field` component, which combines an `Textarea` with a `Label` and displays validation errors. If none of the existing field components suit your needs, it might be worth adding a new one.

```jsx live
<Textarea placeholder="Placeholder text" css={{ width: 340 }} />
```
