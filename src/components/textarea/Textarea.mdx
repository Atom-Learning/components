Textare should be accompanied by labels, so rather than using `Textarea` directly in a UI,
it's normally best to use a `field` component, which combines an `Textarea` with a `Label` and
displays validation errors. If none of the existing field components suit your needs,
it might be worth adding a new one.


```jsx live center
<Textarea placeholder="Placeholder text" css={{ width: 300 }} />
```
