`FileInput` is a specialised input that allows file uploads.

```jsx preview
<FileInput>Upload</FileInput>
```

## Required props

The required props `FileInput` needs are: `onSelect` and `children`.

`onSelect` is a callback that accepts the file selection (as a `FileList`), when the user interacts with the file browser interface. The file selection can then be used by the parent, for example: to be passed in a `POST` API call to be saved.

**Note:** The action of uploading the file to a backend is the parent's responsibility.

`children` is used to add text to the visible button.

## Accessibility

`id` is really important because the actual file input is hidden, while the visible element is a `label` with an `htmlFor` attribute that pairs with the hidden input via the `id` attribute.

**Note:** `id` has to be unique and needs to be provided in cases where the component is used multiple times on the same page.

## Multiple files

The input can also accept multiple files at once, via the `multiple` prop.

```jsx preview
<FileInput onSelect={(fileSelection) => console.log(fileSelection)} multiple>
  Upload
</FileInput>
```

## Restricting the MIME type

The `accept` prop makes the input filter out unwanted file types and prevent the user from selecting them.

```jsx preview
<FileInput
  onSelect={(fileSelection) => console.log(fileSelection)}
  accept="application/pdf"
>
  Upload
</FileInput>
```
