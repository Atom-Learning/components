`FileInput` is a specialised input that allows file uploads.

The 3 most important props it takes are: `onSelect`, `id` and `label`.

`onSelect` is a callback that accepts the actual file selection (as a FileList), which gets updated after the user interacts with the file browser interface. The file selection can then be used in order to build a payload for something like a `POST` API call.

Note: The actual action of uploading the file to a backend is the parent's responsibility.

`id` is really important because the actual file input is hidden, while the visible element is a `label` with an `htmlFor` attribute that pairs with the hidden input via the `id` attribute. 

 Note: `id` has to be unique 

`label` is used to add text to the visible button.

```jsx preview
<FileInput
  onSelect={(fileSelection) => console.log(fileSelection)}
  id="unique-identifier"
  label="Select file"
/>
```

The input can also accept multiple files at once, via the `multiple` prop. Another important feature is the `accept` prop. This makes the input filter out unwanted file types and prevent the user from selecting them.

```jsx preview
<FileInput
  onSelect={(fileSelection) => console.log(fileSelection)}
  id="unique-identifier"
  label="Select file"
  multiple
  accept="application/pdf"
/>
```

You can also use our icon pack to add an icon next to the button text.

```jsx preview
<FileInput
  onSelect={(fileSelection) => console.log(fileSelection)}
  id="unique-identifier"
  label="Select file"
  multiple
  accept="application/pdf"
  icon={Upload}
/>
```
