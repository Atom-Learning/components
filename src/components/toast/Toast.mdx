title: Toast
component: Toast
description: A toast notification that gives non-intrusive feedback to the user and times out automatically
category: Feedback

`Toast` has 2 exports, the `ToastProvider` component which is the container for all the notifications and the `toast` function that allows triggering the notification. It sets all the default behaviour, like pausing on hover and positioning and styles the different types of notification (`info` (default), `error`, `warning` and `success`).

This is the preferred user feedback way as it is not intrusive and it simply provides some state information to the user without waiting for feedback, ie: the information was saved. When feedback is required consider using the `AlertDialog` component.

This component is a wrapper for `react-toastify`

```jsx preview
import { Button, ToastProvider, toast } from '@atom-learning/components'

const Component = () => (
  <Button onClick={() => toast.success('message')}>Click for toast</Button>
)

const App = () => (
  <ToastProvider>
    <Component />
  </ToastProvider>
)
```

This component can render a string message by default. However, it can be overriden to show more complex component structure [Render more than a string](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/render-what-you-want)

For more information on other configuration options and props, please read about the underlying behaviour at [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/)
