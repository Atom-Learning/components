description: A toast notification that gives non-intrusive feedback to the user and times out automatically
category: Feedback

`Toast` has 2 exports, the `ToastProvider` component which is the container for all the notifications and the `toast` function that allows triggering the notification. It sets all the default behaviour, like pausing on hover and positioning and styles the different types of notification (`info` (default), `error`, `warning` and `success`).

This is the preferred user feedback way as it is not intrusive and it simply provides some state information to the user without waiting for feedback, ie: the information was saved. When feedback is required consider using the `AlertDialog` component.

As this component uses `react-toastify` please read more information about the underlying behaviour at [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/)

```jsx preview
import { ToastProvider, toast } from '@atom-learning/components'

const handleSuccess = () => toast.success('message')

<ToastProvider />
```
