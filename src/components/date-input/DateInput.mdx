Date Inputs should be accompanied by labels, so rather than using `DateInput` directly in a UI,
itâ€™s normally best to the `DateField` component, which combines a `DateInput` with a `Label` and
displays validation errors. Alternatively, use this `DateInput` component to compose other field components
with more specific requirements.

`DateInput` is composed from [Dayzed](https://github.com/deseretdigital/dayzed), so further reading on the API can be found there. Some options from Dayzed are set by default in order to provide a uniform experience. For example, the prop `showOutsideDays`, which shows days outside the current calendar month that would appear on the grid, defaults to true in order to avoid extra whitespace.

```tsx preview
<DateInput />
```

## Initial Date

The `DateInput` component allows passing of an initial date, which should be selected by default. If you wish this to be the current date, you can easily use the date shown below. Otherwise strings are also accepted, however those must use a MM/DD/YYYY format. It is recommended to use standard constructors for the date object as per MDN specifications.

```tsx preview
<DateInput initialDate={new Date()} />
```

## Date Format

Any combination of date formats can be passed in as a string, such as "DD/MM/YY" or "YYYY/MM/DD". Default is "DD/MM/YYYY".

A full list of possible formats can be found [here](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format#list-of-all-available-parsing-tokens).

```tsx preview
<DateInput dateFormat="YYYY/MM/DD" />
```

## First Day of Week

The calendar that is rendered by this component can have its first day of the week customised for different locales. The default is 1 (Monday), but for locales such as the US, pass in `firstDayOfWeek={0}` to set it to Sunday.

```tsx preview
<DateInput firstDayOfWeek={0} />
```

## Label Translations

The weekday and month names can be changed to anything you wish (such as translations) by passing in an array of strings to `weekdayNames` and `monthNames`.

NOTE: It is very important that you keep these labels in the right order. Weekdays must be `Sun -> Sat` and months must be `Jan -> Dec`.

```tsx preview
<DateInput
    weekdayNames={['su', 'm', 't', 'w', 'th', 'f', 's']}
    monthNames={{ '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12' ]}
/>
```

You can also translate the internal labels for accessibility purposes. The `labels` prop accepts an object containing three keys, `open`, `next`, and `previous`. These should all be strings.

```tsx preview
<DateInput
  labels={{
    open: 'Open label',
    next: 'Next month label',
    previous: 'Previous month label'
  }}
/>
```
