`Stepper` exports multiple components that combine to create a stepped progress view.

`Stepper.StepBack` represents the backwards navigation element. It must receive `label` as a function that receives `activeStep` as an argument in order to possibly render different labels based on the current step the user is on. It is automatically disabled while the user is viewing the first step.

`Stepper.StepForward` represents the forward navigation element. It must receive `label` as a function that receives `activeStep` as an argument in order to possibly render different labels based on the current step the user is on.

`Stepper.Steps` holds the actual bullet list.

The root `Stepper` component must be passed `stepCount` as a number. It also requires `onStepChange` as a function that takes `activeStep` as an argument. This can be used to determine what content to display, based on the current step. It can also take `onComplete` as a function that gets called when the user clicks the `StepForward` button while on the last step.

```tsx preview
<Stepper
  stepCount={3}
  onComplete={() => console.log('Finished')}
  onStepChange={(activeStep) =>
    console.log('Do something with the active step')
  }
>
  <Stepper.StepBack label={(activeStep) => 'Back'} />
  <Stepper.Steps />
  <Stepper.StepForward
    label={(activeStep) => (activeStep === 2 ? 'Finish' : 'Next')}
  />
</Stepper>
```

The root ProgressIndicator component can also take an `allowSkip` prop that allows the user to navigate by clicking the actual bullets.

```tsx preview
<Stepper
  stepCount={3}
  allowSkip
  onComplete={() => console.log('Finished')}
  onStepChange={(activeStep) =>
    console.log('Do something with the active step')
  }
>
  <Stepper.StepBack label={(activeStep) => 'Back'} />
  <Stepper.Steps />
  <Stepper.StepForward
    label={(activeStep) => (activeStep === 2 ? 'Finish' : 'Next')}
  />
</Stepper>
```
