`ProgressIndicator` exports multiple components that combine to create a Progress Indicator view.

`ProgressIndicator.NavigatePrevious` represents the backwards navigation element. It must receive text as its child in order to render a label on the underlying Button element. It is automatically disabled while the user is viewing the first step.

`ProgressIndicator.NavigateNext` represents the forward navigation element. It must also receive text as its child in order to render a label on the underlying Button element. Apart from that, it can also receive `finalLabel` and `finalAction` props. When the user reaches the final step, the `finalLabel` gets rendered, while clicking the element triggers `finalAction`.

`ProgressIndicator.Steps` holds the actual bullet list.

The root `ProgressIndicator` component must be passed `stepsData` in the form of an array.

```tsx preview
<ProgressIndicator stepsData={[1, 2, 3]}>
  <ProgressIndicator.NavigatePrevious>
    Back
  </ProgressIndicator.NavigatePrevious>
  <ProgressIndicator.Steps/>
  <ProgressIndicator.NavigateNext finalLabel="Start" finalAction={() => console.log('Finished)}>
    Next
  </ProgressIndicator.NavigateNext>
</Dialog>
```

The root `ProgressIndicator` component can also take an `allowSkip` prop. When this prop is passed, the user is allowed to click the actual bullets in order to navigate.

```tsx preview
<ProgressIndicator stepsData={[1, 2, 3]} allowSkip>
  <ProgressIndicator.NavigatePrevious>
    Back
  </ProgressIndicator.NavigatePrevious>
  <ProgressIndicator.Steps/>
  <ProgressIndicator.NavigateNext finalLabel="Start" finalAction={() => console.log('Finished)}>
    Next
  </ProgressIndicator.NavigateNext>
</Dialog>
```
