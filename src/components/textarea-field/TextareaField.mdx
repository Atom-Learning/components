TextareaField is the preferred way to render a form field for multi-line text.

In addition to text `Label` (required) and a validation error (optional), TextareaField accepts all the same props as `Textarea` and will pass them on to the `textarea` it renders. However, as with all our composed components, `TextareaField`'s css prop will be applied to a containing Box â€” the styling of the individual components inside `TextareaField` cannot be altered.

```jsx preview
<Form>
  <TextareaField name="example" id="example" />
</Form>
```
