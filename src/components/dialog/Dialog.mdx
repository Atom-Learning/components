`Dialog` exports many components that combine to create a modal. The `Dialog.Trigger` requires a React component child (or passed to `as`) to allow the necessary event bindings and accessible properties to be cloned.

Also, note that the component must accept a `ref`.

Read more about the underlying UI component on the [Radix UI documentation site](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog).

```jsx preview
<Dialog>
  <Dialog.Trigger>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Content>
    <Heading size="sm" css={{ mb: '$3' }}>
      Dialog
    </Heading>
    <Text size="sm" css={{ mb: '$3' }}>
      The `Dialog` can display any type of element as a trigger and has the
      content hidden by default
    </Text>
    <Button appearance="outline" size="sm" as={Dialog.Close}>
      Close Dialog
    </Button>
  </Dialog.Content>
</Dialog>
```
