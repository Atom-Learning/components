It adds default styling and the `css` prop.

Labels are associated with controls like `input` or `checkbox`, however before using this component consider using one of the provided `Field` components that are available. Use this `Label` to compose more complex `Field` type components.

## Accessibility

For accessibility purposes the component needs either to have the `htmlFor` prop set to link it to the control it is associated with or to wrap around the component that it is labelling.

## Sizes

```tsx preview
<Label size="sm">A small label</Label>
```

```tsx preview
<Label>A normal label</Label>
```

## Required

To denote a required field, the `required` prop will add an `*` suffix to the label text.

```tsx preview
<Label required>A normal label</Label>
```
