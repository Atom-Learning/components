# Label

`Label` is a thin wrapper around the basic HTML `<label/>` element. It adds default styling and the `css` prop.

Labels are associated with controls like `input` or `checkbox`, however before using this component consider using one of the provided `Field` components that are available. Use this `Label` to compose more complex `Field` type components.

## Accessibility

For accessibility purposes the component needs either to have the `htmlFor` prop set to link it to the control it is associated with or to wrap around the component that it is labelling.

## Sizes

The default size is `md`.

### `sm`

<Label size="sm" htmlFor="controlId">
  A small label
</Label>

### `md`

<Label>A normal label</Label>
