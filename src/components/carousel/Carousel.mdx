title: Carousel
component: Carousel
description: The `Carousel` displays a series of slides that can be swiped between or selected directly via buttons.
category: Media
---

The `Carousel` must contain a `Carousel.Slider` with nested `Carousel.Slide`s and optionally can include a `Carousel.Pagination` and `Carousel.Arrows`.
`Carousel.Slider`'s optional `overflow` prop will cause it to render all slides at once, allowing the user to drag them into view. The `aria-selected` attribute can be used as a CSS selector to style slides according to whether they are currently selected (see below).

Note that `Carousel.Slide`s must receive an `index` prop in order to correctly apply styling based on whether they are selected and that `Carousel.Arrows` should be rendered inside a parent with `position: relative` in order to be positioned correctly.

```jsx preview
<Carousel
  slideWidth={200}
  slideHeight={300}
  numSlides={4}
  css={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', position: 'relative' }}
>
  <Carousel.Arrows />
  <Carousel.Slider aria-label="Example carousel" trayTag="div">
    {[0, 1, 2, 3].map((num) => (
      <Carousel.Slide
        key={num}
        index={num}
        aria-label={`slide ${num}`}
        css={{
          opacity: '0.7',
          transition: 'all 0.25s ease-in',
          '&[aria-selected="true"]': {
            opacity: 1,
            // apply box shadow to the Slide content directly,
            // not the wrappers added internally
            '& > div > div > *': {
              boxShadow: '$1'
            }
          }
        }}
      >
        <Image alt="" src="https://placekitten.com/200/300" />
      </Carousel.Slide>
    ))}
  </Carousel.Slider>
  <Carousel.Pagination />
</Carousel>
```
