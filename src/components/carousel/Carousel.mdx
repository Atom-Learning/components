title: Carousel
component: Carousel
description: The `Carousel` displays a series of slides that can be swiped between or selected directly via buttons.
category: Media

The `Carousel`'s children must be a series of `Carousel.Slide`s. Each `Carousel.Slide` requires an `index` (`number`) so that it can be highlighted correctly when selected.

```jsx preview
<Carousel slideWidth={200} slideHeight={300}>
  {[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].map((num) => (
    <Carousel.Slide key={num} index={num}>
      <Image src="https://placekitten.com/200/300" />
    </Carousel.Slide>
  ))}
</Carousel>
```
