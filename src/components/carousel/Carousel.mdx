The `Carousel` must contain a `Carousel.Slider` with nested `Carousel.Slide`s and optionally can include a `Carousel.Pagination` and `Carousel.ArrowPrevious` / `Carousel.ArrowNext` for navigation between slides.
`Carousel.Slider`'s optional `overflow` prop will cause it to render all slides at once, allowing the user to drag them into view. The `aria-selected` attribute can be used as a CSS selector to style slides according to whether they are currently selected (see below).

Note that `Carousel.Slide`s must receive an `index` prop in order to correctly apply styling based on whether they are selected and that `Carousel.Arrows` should be rendered inside a parent with `position: relative` in order to be positioned correctly.

```tsx preview
<Carousel
  slideWidth={400}
  slideHeight={350}
  numSlides={2}
  css={{ position: 'relative' }}
>
  <Carousel.ArrowPrevious css={{ position: 'absolute', left: '$2' }} />
  <Carousel.ArrowNext css={{ position: 'absolute', right: '$2' }} />

  <Carousel.Slider aria-label="Example carousel">
    <Carousel.Slide index={1} aria-label="Slide 1">
      <Image alt="" src="https://atomlearning.co.uk/images/key-img.png" />
    </Carousel.Slide>
    <Carousel.Slide index={2} aria-label="Slide 2">
      <Image alt="" src="https://atomlearning.co.uk/images/nucleus-img-2.png" />
    </Carousel.Slide>
  </Carousel.Slider>

  <Carousel.Pagination />
</Carousel>
```
