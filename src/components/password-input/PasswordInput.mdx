component: PasswordInput
description: An input for passwords with visibility toggle functionality
category: Forms

`PasswordInput` wraps `Input` with a content visibility toggle, triggered by interaction with an eye Icon.

For most use cases it is better to use `PasswordField`, which includes a label, hooks into our `Form` component and shows validation errors where appropriate.
Only use `PasswordInput` if you need to compose something that behaves differently to the `PasswordField` and be sure to include a label manually.

```jsx preview
<PasswordInput name="password" />
```
