The `Video` component supports playing Vimeo hosted videos by setting the externalId.

```jsx preview center
<Video externalId="1084537" />
```

A lighter version can be loaded by setting the `lightPlayer` prop and the `height` and `width` can be adjusted.

```jsx preview center
<Video externalId="1084537" lightPlayer width="100px" height="110px" />
```
