The `Video` component supports playing Vimeo hosted videos by setting the externalId.

```tsx preview
<Video externalId="1084537" />
```

This component makes the video responsive by having a default ratio of `16:9`. However, this can be overriden by setting the `ratio` prop.

```tsx preview
<Video externalId="1084537" ratio={2 / 3} />
```
