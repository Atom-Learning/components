description: The `RadioButton` component implements the Radio component from [Radix](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/radio-group) with default styling and the `css` prop.

It needs to be wrapped with the `RadioButtonGroup` as it will not load without it. If only one `RadioButton` is needed please consider using a checkbox instead.

A `RadioButton` needs to be associated with a label for accessibility purposes and to display the text for it. So rather than using the `RadioButton` component directly in a UI, consider using a `RadioButtonField`, which provides a `Label` and displays validation errors. Use this `RadioButton` to compose more complex `Field` type components.
