The `Image` component renders an `img` element with basic styling to stop it from overflowing its parent element or expanding beyond its natural size and distorting.

```tsx preview
<Image
  src="https://atomlearning.co.uk/images/key-img.png"
  alt="An Atom Learning user riding a pencil rocket"
/>
```
