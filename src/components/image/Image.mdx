title: Image
component: Image

The `Image` component renders an `img` element with basic styling to stop it from overflowing its parent element or expanding beyond its natural size and distorting.

```jsx preview center
<Image src="http://placekitten.com/280/120" alt="Cats having a nice time" />
```
