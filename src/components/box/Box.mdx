`Box` can largely be seen as an abstraction over the `div` element. It is most useful when used as a generic containing component, and when paired with `as` and `css` allows a high degree of composition and flexibility.

`Box` falls back to rendering a `div`, but we should use it to render more sematically relevant container elements e.g. `<Box as="section">`. As an example, a card component could use `Box` to render a `section`, `header` and `footer`.

Avoid rendering any of these elements directly in our components â€” `Box` has all the same flexibility, but with the addition of the powerful `css` prop and various styling utilities based on our themes.

## Example

To show an example of the benefits of using `Box`, the card below is composed together using `Box` alongside other relevant components:

```tsx live
<Box
  as="article"
  css={{
    border: '1px solid $tonal100',
    borderRadius: '$2',
    overflow: 'hidden',
    width: '320px'
  }}
>
  <Box as="figure" css={{ m: 0, position: 'relative' }}>
    <Image src="http://placekitten.com/320/200" alt="Cats having a nice time" />
    <Text
      as="figcaption"
      size="sm"
      css={{
        bottom: '$2',
        color: 'white',
        position: 'absolute',
        right: '$2'
      }}
    >
      Here is a cute cat
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box css={{ px: '$3', py: '$4' }}>
    <Heading as="h2" size="sm" css={{ mb: '$3' }}>
      Cat
    </Heading>
    <Text>
      The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Box>
```
