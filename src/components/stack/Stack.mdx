description: Stack is a layout component that provides an abstraction over the flexbox gap property
category: Layout

`Stack` is a single axis layout component enabling you to space items evenly within it using the `gap` prop and change the direction of content with `direction`. In an ideal world this component would be redundant as `gap` would be widely supported when used with `display: flex`; unfortunately browser support [isn't great](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap) with Safari being the last major browser yet to implement it. `@supports()` would usually enable us to progressively enable this property but there's no way to test when it's used alongside flexbox, as `gap` is also used in `display: grid`. Until we gain greater browser support, this `Stack` component should provide a similar output.

```tsx live
<Stack gap="2" direction="column">
  <Button>Hello</Button>
  <Button>Hello</Button>
  <Button>Hello</Button>
</Stack>
```
