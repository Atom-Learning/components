The NotificationBadge component is a lightweight wrapper for content such as ActionIcons, but can be wrapped around anything.

It displays a badge in top right of the content it is wrapping, which displays a `value` passed in as a prop. This could be, for example, the number of filters selected on a select filters badge.

```tsx preview
<NotificationBadge value={3}>
  <ActionIcon appearance="outline" size="lg" isRounded>
    <Icon is={Controls} />
  </ActionIcon>
</NotificationBadge>
```

## Value

Whilst you would normally want to display a number, the `value` prop also supports strings.

## Themes

The component accepts a `theme` prop of either `primary`, `dark`, or `neutral`. Default is `primary`. It can also take an `appearance` prop, which can either be `simple` or `outline`. Default is `simple`.
