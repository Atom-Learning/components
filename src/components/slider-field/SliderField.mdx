`SliderField` renders a `Slider` with a label, and easy implementation with `Form`.

In it's most simple form, a slider allows one value to be set between two given values (default 0 and 100).

Please note: the `value` or `defaultValue` passed in should always be an array.

```tsx preview
<Form>
  <SliderField name="slider" label="Select a value" defaultValue={[50]} />
</Form>
```
