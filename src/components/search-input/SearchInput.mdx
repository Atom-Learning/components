`SearchInput` wraps `Input` and adds an icon to visualise the specific input type, it's recommended to use this component when the user is performing a search query. It is functionally identical to the standard `Input` aside from a more specific "type" but makes it clear to the user what the action is and what potential feedback they might receive.

```tsx preview
<SearchInput name="search" css={{ width: 320 }} placeholder="Search" />
```
