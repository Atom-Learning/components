The `Slider` is a simple component that renders a form slider.

The `Slider` component should be rendered with a label for accesibility reasons. Rather than using the `Slider` component directly, it is best to use the `SliderField` component, which provides a label and easily integrates with the `Form` component.

Should you wish to create a more complex UI with `Field` components, you should use this base component.

Please note: the `value` or `defaultValue` passed in should always be an array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[50]} />
```

## Multiple Values

Should you wish to have more than one control on the slider, you can pass those values in the array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[25, 75]} />
```

## Steps and Labels

The slider can output an array of labels which appear at given value points along the slider. These are passed in to the `steps` property using an array objects that contain a label and a value.

Note: it is likely better to create steps as a constant and pass in with `steps={steps}` or similar, but this preview code cannot see values outside of JSX.

```tsx preview
<Slider
  steps={[
    { value: 0, label: 'min' },
    { value: 50, label: 'mid' },
    { value: 100, label: 'max' }
  ]}
  defaultValue={[50]}
/>
```

These values should be limited to the `min` and `max` values that can be passed in to the slider object, as it is not limited to a 0-100 range.

The steps work well with the built in `step` property, which defaults to 1 and changes the size of each movement. For example, this would limit the slider to three values only.

```tsx preview
<Slider
  steps={[
    { value: 10, label: 'min' },
    { value: 15, label: 'mid' },
    { value: 20, label: 'max' }
  ]}
  step={5}
  min={10}
  max={20}
  defaultValue={[15]}
/>
```

## Value output

The slider can be set to display a label below the track displaying the current value selected. To do this, pass in the prop `showValue`.

NOTE: this will only work if there is only one value selected. In order to not overly complicate the output, it is recommended to indicate multiple values using `steps` (see above). Should you pass in this prop with multiple values, the value output will not be rendered.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[50]} showValue />
```

By default this simply outputs the value, however this can be customised in a number of ways. `outputLabel` can be passed, which is a string that must contain the `$VALUE`. This will be replaced with the value when it renders. A string is used so that the value can be placed wherever it needs to be in the output sentence, such as in the example below.

You can also put the string `$ITEM` in `outputLabel`, which will be replaced with either a single or plural depending on the current value. This relies on the prop `item` being passed, which should be an object with two keys, `single` and `plural`. These strings allow the handling of non standard plurals. This is shown in the example below.

Another prop, `emptyData`, accepts a `label` and `value` object, and tells the output at what value the label should be replaced. This typically would be an empty state, such as in the example below.

```tsx preview
<Slider
  defaultValue={[50]}
  showValue
  outputLabel="You have selected $VALUE $ITEM"
  item={{ single: 'goose', plural: 'geese' }}
  emptyData={{ label: 'No geese selected', value: 0 }}
/>
```

## Styling

Depending on the background of your page, you can change the theme of the track to be either light or tonal using `theme="light"`. Default is `theme="tonal"`.

```tsx preview
<Slider theme="light" defaultValue={[50]} />
```
