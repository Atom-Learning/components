The `Slider` is a simple component that renders a form slider.

The `Slider` component should be rendered with a label for accesibility reasons. Rather than using the `Slider` component directly, it is best to use the `SliderField` component, which provides a field label, a value label, and easily integrates with the `Form` component.

Should you wish to create a more complex UI with `Field` components, you should use this base component.

Please note: the `value` or `defaultValue` passed in should always be an array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[50]} />
```

## Multiple Values

Should you wish to have more than one control on the slider, you can pass those values in the array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[25, 75]} />
```

## Slider.Steps

A separate component exists to output an array of labels which appear at given value points along the slider. These are passed in to the `steps` property using an array objects that contain a label and a value.

This is most commonly used within the `SliderField`, but is here in case you need to compose your own complex component.

Note: it is likely better to create steps as a constant and pass in with `steps={steps}` or similar, but this preview code cannot see values outside of JSX.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[50]}>
  <Slider.Steps
    min={0}
    max={100}
    steps={[
      { value: 0, label: 'min' },
      { value: 50, label: 'mid' },
      { value: 100, label: 'max' }
    ]}
  />
</Slider>
```

The component requires min and max values, these should be the same as the optional values that are passed to the Slider component.

`Slider.Steps` work well with the built in `step` property, which defaults to 1 and changes the size of each movement. For example, this would limit the slider to three values only.

```tsx
<Slider defaultValue={[50]} min={10} max={20} step={5}>
  <Slider.Steps
    min={10}
    max={20}
    steps={[
      { value: 10, label: 'min' },
      { value: 15, label: 'mid' },
      { value: 20, label: 'max' }
    ]}
  />
</Slider>
```

## Slider.Value

A separate component exists to output the value from a slider. This is most commonly used within the `SliderField`, but is here in case you need to compose your own complex component.

```tsx preview
<Slider.Value value={[50]} />
```

By default this simply outputs the value, however, this can be customised in a number of ways. The property `outputLabel` accepts a function that passes the value selected in the slider and expects a string returned for the label.

You can also use this is in more complex ways, for example to set empty states and pluralisation, like below.

```tsx preview
<Slider.Value
  value={[50]}
  outputLabel={(value) =>
    value === 0
      ? 'You have no geese'
      : `You have ${value} ${value === 1 ? 'goose' : 'geese'}`
  }
/>
```

Should you wish to use the label with multiple values, you can use `Array.join()` like below.

```tsx
<Slider.Value
  value={[25, 75]}
  outputLabel={(value) => `You have between ${value.join(' and ')} geese`}
/>
```

## Styling

Depending on the background of your page, you can change the theme of the track to be either light or tonal using `theme="light"`. Default is `theme="tonal"`.

```tsx preview
<Slider theme="light" defaultValue={[50]} />
```
