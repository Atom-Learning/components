The `Slider` is a simple component that renders a form slider.

The `Slider` component should be rendered with a label for accesibility reasons. Rather than using the `Slider` component directly, it is best to use the `SliderField` component, which provides a label and easily integrates with the `Form` component.

Should you wish to create a more complex UI with `Field` components, you should use this base component.

Please note: the `value` or `defaultValue` passed in should always be an array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[50]} />
```

## Multiple Values

Should you wish to have more than one control on the slider, you can pass those values in the array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[25, 75]} />
```

## Styling

The `Slider` track defaults to having a border, but should you wish to remove this you can pass `border="none"`

```tsx preview
<Slider border="none" defaultValue={[50]} />
```
