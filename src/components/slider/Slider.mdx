The `Slider` is a simple component that renders a form slider.

The `Slider` component should be rendered with a label for accesibility reasons. Rather than using the `Slider` component directly, it is best to use the `SliderField` component, which provides a label and easily integrates with the `Form` component.

Should you wish to create a more complex UI with `Field` components, you should use this base component.

Please note: the `value` or `defaultValue` passed in should always be an array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[50]} />
```

## Multiple Values

Should you wish to have more than one control on the slider, you can pass those values in the array.

```tsx preview
<Slider defaultValue={[25, 75]} />
```

## Steps and Labels

The slider can output an array of labels which appear at given value points along the slider. These are passed in to the `steps` property using an array objects that contain a label and a value.

```tsx preview
const steps = [
    { value: 0, label: "min" },
    { value: 50, label: "mid" },
    { value: 100, label: "max" }
]

<Slider steps={steps} defaultValue={[50]} />
```

These values should be limited to the `min` and `max` values that can be passed in to the slider object, as it is not limited to a 0-100 range.

The steps work well with the built in `step` property, which defaults to 1 and changes the size of each movement. For example, this would limit the slider to three values only.

```tsx preview
const steps = [
    { value: 10, label: "min" },
    { value: 15, label: "mid" },
    { value: 20, label: "max" }
]

<Slider steps={steps} step={5} min={10} max={20} defaultValue={[15]} />
```

## Styling

Depending on the background of your page, you can change the theme of the track to be either light or dark using `theme="light"`. Default is `theme="dark"`.

```tsx preview
<Slider theme="light" defaultValue={[50]} />
```
