description: An implementation of the Switch component from Radix with default styling and the css prop
category: Forms
---

The `Switch` component implements [Radix's Switch component](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/switch).

Switches are used to toggle application state between two mutually exlusive values. The `Switch` defaults to the "off" state unless it's rendered with the `defaultChecked` prop.

The `Switch` component should not be used to collect form data â€” use checkboxes or radio buttons for that. Only use `Switch` inside a form if it is serving its primary purpose of toggling some state with immediate effect (e.g. to conditionally render a section of the form).

```tsx preview
<Switch />
```

## Disabled state

The `disabled` stated can be set using the `disabled` property.

```tsx preview
<Switch disabled/>
```

## Accessibility
