description: An implementation of the Switch component from Radix with default styling and the css prop
category: Forms
---

The Switch component implements [Radix's Switch component](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/switch) where the default value can be set via `default` props.

Switches are used to change the state of functionality and preferences. They prompt users to choose between two mutually exclusive options and will always have a default value.

The Switch component should not be used to handle data (e.g. where we submit data in a form it's encouraged to use checkboxes or radio buttons). Instead it should be used interactively where the effect is an immediate display or state change.


## Appearance
```tsx live
<Switch />
```

## Disabled state

The `disabled` stated can be set using the `disabled` property.

```tsx preview
<Switch disabled/>
```

## Accessibility
Adheres to the `switch` [role requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#switch)
