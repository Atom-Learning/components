The `Grid` component implements a simple flex-box based grid as described [here](https://github.com/Heydon/fukol-grids).
Its `gap` prop specifies, in any valid CSS units, the distance between items in the grid. Its `basis` prop specifies, in any valid CSS units, the minimum size of each grid item (by default this will set their `width`, but if the `css` prop is used to set `flex-direction` to `column` then it will set `height` instead).

```jsx preview
<Grid basis="0.5em" gap="0.05em">
  {[0, 1, 2, 3].map((num) => (
    <Image key={num} src="https://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="" />
  ))}
</Grid>
```
