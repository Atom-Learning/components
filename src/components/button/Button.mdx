It adds default styling and the `css` prop. By default `primary` theme is displayed with a `solid` appearance.

```jsx live center
<Button>Hello world</Button>
```

## Themes

These are the available `themes` for the `Button` component: `Primary` (default), `Secondary`, `Tertiary`, `Success`, `Warning`, `Danger`

```jsx preview center
<Button>Primary</Button>
<Button theme="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button theme="tertiary">Tertiary</Button>
<Button theme="success">Success</Button>
<Button theme="warning">Warning</Button>
<Button theme="danger">Error</Button>
```

## Appearance

There two options for the `appearance` property: `solid` and `outline`. These are the available `outline` variations for the `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary` themes.

```jsx preview center
<Button appearance="outline">Primary</Button>
<Button appearance="outline" theme="secondary">
  Secondary
</Button>
<Button appearance="outline" theme="tertiary">
  Tertiary
</Button>
```

## Disabled state

Each variation has an `disabled` stated, by setting the `disabled` property.

```jsx preview center
<Button disabled>Disabled button</Button>
<Button theme="success" disabled>
  Disabled button
</Button>
<Button appearance="outline" theme="secondary" disabled>
  Disabled button
</Button>
<Button appearance="outline" theme="tertiary" disabled>
  Disabled button
</Button>
```

## Loading state

When using a button to request data or fire an action that has a potential delay, including a loading state to the button can be a useful indicator that stuff is happening. The `isLoading` prop must be a boolean value to activate the loading state.

```jsx live center
<Button isloading> Hello world</Button>
```
