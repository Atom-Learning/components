It adds default styling and the `css` prop. By default `primary` theme is displayed with a `solid` appearance.

```tsx live
<Button>Hello world</Button>
```

## Themes

These are the available `themes` for the `Button` component: `primary` (default), `success`, `warning`, `danger`

```tsx preview
<>
  <Button>Primary</Button>
  <Button theme="success">Success</Button>
  <Button theme="warning">Warning</Button>
  <Button theme="danger">Danger</Button>
</>
```

## Appearance

There two options for the `appearance` property: `solid` and `outline`. These are the available `outline` variations for the `primary` theme.

```tsx preview
<Button appearance="outline">Primary</Button>
```

## Disabled state

Each variation has an `disabled` stated, by setting the `disabled` property.

```tsx preview
<>
  <Button disabled>Disabled button</Button>
  <Button theme="success" disabled>
    Disabled button
  </Button>
</>
```

## Loading state

When using a button to request data or fire an action that has a potential delay, including a loading state to the button can be a useful indicator that stuff is happening. The `isLoading` prop must be a boolean value to activate the loading state.

```tsx live
<Button isLoading> Hello world</Button>
```

## Rounded Variant

Setting `isRounded` creates a rounded button

```tsx live
<Button isRounded>Rounded Button</Button>
```

## Polymorphism

The `Button` component supports polymorphism, therefore depending on whether it receives an `onClick`/`href` as a prop, it will produce a `button` or `link` respectively

```tsx
<Button href="http://example.com/">I'm a link</Button>
```

```tsx
<Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>I'm a button</Button>
```

## Child icons

`Button` also applies relevant sizing and spacing values to any child `Icon`s, aligning with the `Button`s size and appearance. Using an `Icon` as the first or last child in `Button` will set the correct space between itself and the sibling text.

```tsx preview
<Button>
  <Icon is={Language} />
  Change language
</Button>
```
