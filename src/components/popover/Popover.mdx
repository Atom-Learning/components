`Popover` exports 3 components that combine to create our popover. The `Popover.Trigger` requires a React component child (or passed to `as`) to allow the necessary event bindings and accessible properties to be cloned.

Also, note that the component must accept a `ref`.

Read more about the underlying UI component on the [Radix UI documentation site](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/popover).

```jsx preview
<Popover>
  <Popover.Trigger>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </Popover.Trigger>
  <Popover.Content>
    <Heading size="xs" css={{ mb: '$3' }}>
      Popover
    </Heading>
    <Text size="sm">
      The `Popover` can display any type of element as a trigger and has the
      content hidden by default
    </Text>
  </Popover.Content>
</Popover>
```
