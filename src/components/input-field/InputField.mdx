title: InputField
component: InputField
description: InputField renders a field composed of an Input, a Label and a ValidationError
---

`InputField` is the preferred way to render a form field for single-line text and number data.

As well as text for its `Label`, `InputField` accepts all the same props as `Input` and will pass them on to the `Input` it renders. However, as with all our composed components,
`InputField`'s `css` prop will be applied to a containing `CSSWrapper`â€”the styling of the individual components inside `InputField` cannot be altered. Err on the side of using consistent form fields,
but if you really need something with different styling then consider composing your own field from the `Input`, `Label` and `ValidationError` components.

```jsx live center
<InputField placeholder="Placeholder text" css={{ width: 300 }} />
```
