Checkboxes should be accompanied by labels, so rather than using `Checkbox` directly in a UI,
itâ€™s normally best to the `CheckboxField` component, which combines a `Checkbox` with a `Label` and
displays validation errors. Alternatively, use this `Checkbox` component to compose other field components
with more specific requirements.

```tsx preview
<Checkbox />
```
