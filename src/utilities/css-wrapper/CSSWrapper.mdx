title: CSS Wrapper
component: CSSWrapper
category: Utilities
---

If `CSSWrapper` is passed a truthy `css` prop, it renders its children wrapped in a `Box` with that `css`. If `css` is falsy, `CSSWrapper`
just renders its children.

Use `CSSWrapper` to wrap other components that have no natural container, but **only if the addition of a `<Box />` won't change the component's layout behaviour**.
