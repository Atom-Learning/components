## Description
- If you're fixing a bug, describe the symptoms, cause and fix. 
- If you're adding a new component, give a quick description of its purpose and functionality.
- Link to the relevant Jira ticket
- If there is a relevant Figma design, link to that too

## Screenshots / video
- If you're fixing a bug, show the before *and* after
- If you're building a new component, include screenshots of any relevant variants/states
- If you're building an _interactive_ component, include a video of the interaction

## Review
- If you're making any visual changes, you must get a design review from @MiguelGDLR. If you're fixing a small, well-defined problem e.g. `The border-radius on Button should be bumped up to 6px` then sharing screenshots with Miguel will probably suffice. For new components, a call and a screen-share is probably better.
- Miguel would also be **delighted** to help you out during development if you have any queries about the designs or how things should work!
